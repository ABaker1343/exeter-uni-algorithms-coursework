abstract = {A simple and efficient curvilinear feature extraction algorithm is described. The algorithm is based on minimum spanning trees of edge points and closely related to Zahn's previous work on Gestalt clustering. Examples drawn from real world images are shown to demonstrate the capabilities and applicabilities of the algorithm. Stimulating interest and inducing application of the algorithm in the areas of computer vision and image understanding are among the major objectives of the paper.}
