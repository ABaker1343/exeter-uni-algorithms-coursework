## This is my "algorithms that changed the world" continuous assessment
I have chosen to do bokurva's minimum spanning tree algorithm
to run the algorithm use: "python algorithm.py" or "python algorithm.py -g" to see a graphical output
if python command does not work try using "python3"

### python requirements
matplotlib
networkx
tk
